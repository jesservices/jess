press f1 to start detection:

A program designed to detect the purple enemy color outline in valorant, when enemy is in your crosshair, the application shoots for you, giving the user inhumane reaction times. 

currently use RGB scales to look for the specific enemy color code. 
Uses "k" as an input to "shoot"


problems:
detects purple well in the 7x7 pixel in the middle of the screen, but when in game does not detect purple but likes to shoot at darker areas in the game. 
Do not know how to fix.
